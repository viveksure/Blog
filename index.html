              Efficiently tracking student attendance during daily activities presents challenges due to the slow and susceptible nature of the traditional name-calling method. To address this, a proposed system leverages facial recognition technology for precise attendance record-keeping. I understand. "The system maintains and is preconfigured by the administrator with the attendance records for each subject." As class times approach, the system automatically captures images and employs face detection and recognition techniques. Recognized students are promptly marked as present, updating their attendance with timestamps and subject IDs. Deep learning methods, including histograms of oriented gradients for face detection and deep learning for face recognition, enable accurate identification. Notably, the system can simultaneously recognize multiple faces in real time, revolutionizing attendance management.

            Different organizations have different ways of keeping track of their students’ attendance. Some use manual methods like calling out names or using paper sheets, while others use biometric systems like fingerprints, RFID card readers, or iris scanners. However, these methods have some drawbacks, such as being time-consuming, prone to loss or misuse of cards, or not very accurate. A better alternative is to use face recognition technology, which is fast and prevents proxy attendance. Face recognition involves two steps: detecting faces in an image and matching them with a database of known faces. There are various face recognition methods based on the whole face appearance or specific facial features like eyes, nose, eyebrows, and cheeks.

            Our system uses a machine learning approach for face recognition, which requires a high-quality camera to capture the students’ images. The face detection is done by using a histogram of oriented gradients, and the face recognition is done by using deep learning. The system has a frontend (client side) that consists of a GUI based on Electron JS and a backend (server side) that consists of logic and Python. An IPC (Inter-Personal Communication) bridge is used to communicate between these two stacks. The camera captures images which are then sent to the system for analysis. The system compares the input image with a set of reference images of each student and based on that, marks their attendance.
            
            Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have played a vital role in various applications such as surveillance, object detection, and object tracking, among others. A considerable body of research has been dedicated to leveraging CNNs for face recognition, a crucial component of surveillance applications. Recently, the use of face recognition techniques has gained prominence in university automation systems and smart entry management systems. This paper introduces an innovative CNN architecture designed for face recognition systems, along with the data collection process for students' facial information. 
            
            THIS_IS_A_REWRITE: The experimental results demonstrate an impressive 99% accuracy rate for the proposed CNN architecture. Furthermore, the CNN framework introduced here has been used to create a user-friendly "Smart Attendance Management System (SAMS)" web-based application for real-time student attendance tracking through face recognition, making it easy to deploy and maintain.

          Traditional methods of tracking student attendance, such as manual roll calls or paper-based systems, are often slow, error-prone, and susceptible to proxies. This inefficiency poses challenges for educational institutions and organizations that need an accurate and efficient attendance management system. To address these issues, our project aims to develop a "Smart Attendance Management System Using Face Recognition."<br>

          The problem can be summarized as follows:<br>
          
          Inefficient Attendance Tracking: Traditional methods of taking attendance in classrooms or at various organizational events are time-consuming and can lead to inaccuracies due to human errors.<br>
          
          Proxy Attendance: In traditional systems, there is a risk of proxy attendance, where one student can mark attendance on behalf of another, leading to incorrect records.<br>
          
          Limited Scalability: Manual attendance tracking becomes increasingly challenging as class sizes or event attendance grow, making it difficult to maintain accurate records.<br>
          
          Loss of Attendance Records: Paper-based systems can result in the loss or damage of attendance records, making it challenging to maintain a reliable historical record of attendance.<br>
          
          Inaccuracy: Manual attendance methods may lead to inaccuracies in marking, which can affect academic or organizational performance evaluations.<br>
          
          Time-Consuming: The process of calling out names or passing attendance sheets consumes valuable class or event time.<br>
          
          Security and Privacy: In systems using cards or other methods, there may be security and privacy concerns related to the use and storage of personal information.<br>
          
          Our proposed solution is to develop a smart attendance management system that leverages facial recognition technology to address these challenges. The system will automatically capture and recognize students' faces, mark their attendance in real-time, and maintain accurate records. This system will improve efficiency, reduce the risk of proxy attendance, and provide a scalable solution for various educational and organizational settings.        <br>            </p>

        The proposed system offers a comprehensive solution for automating attendance management in diverse organizations, mitigating the shortcomings of traditional manual methods. It operates on a subject-specific attendance calculation model. An administrator manually inputs student and subject data, and when the time for a particular subject arrives, the system automatically initiates image capture. Utilizing the Histogram of Oriented Gradient for face detection and deep learning techniques for 128-dimensional face feature calculation and comparison, the system recognizes individuals based on the existing database. It records attendance for the recognized students in real time and generates and saves an Excel sheet autonomously.

        This system comprises two integral components. First, the front-end employs a user-friendly GUI built using Electron JS, functioning as the client. The second component, the backend, hosts the core logic and is implemented in Python, serving as the server. Given the distinct nature of these languages, they rely on Inter-Personal Communication (IPC) techniques facilitated by the Zero library to bridge the communication gap. Electron JS invokes Python functions and facilitates data exchange via TCP communication with the invaluable support of the Zero PC Library.
        
        <br>Data Acquisition
        <br>Image acquisition: Images are captured through the use of a high-definition camera strategically positioned in the classroom. These images are subsequently fed into the system as input for further analysis and processing.
        
        <br>Dataset Creation: To facilitate the recognition process, an extensive student dataset is thoughtfully curated, primarily serving as training material for the system. This dataset encompasses a total of five students, each meticulously documented with their name, roll number, department, and an array of images capturing them in diverse poses and conditions. To enhance precision, it's imperative that a minimum of 15 images are captured for each student. When student data and images are registered in our system for dataset creation, deep learning techniques are applied to each facial image, meticulously calculating the intricate 128-dimensional facial features. These computed features are then securely stored within the student's face data file, ensuring their accessibility during the recognition phase. This methodical process is diligently applied to every image captured during the registration procedure.
        
        <br>Storing: We've employed the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format for storing and managing student data within the system. JSON serves as a structured data representation based on the syntax of JavaScript objects. It's a widely recognized text-based format commonly used for data transmission in web applications. JSON is particularly well-suited for storing temporary data consumed by the entity that generates it. It can efficiently store data in various forms, including String, Number, Object, Array, Boolean, and Null. However, it's important to note that JSON does have limitations when it comes to storing data in the form of functions, dates, or undefined values. If your data storage or exchange needs involve functions or dates, JSON may not be the most suitable choice.
                                                                 
        <br>Face recognition process
        <br>Face Detection and Extraction: The process of face detection holds great significance. When the system receives an image captured by the camera, it's imperative to swiftly identify and pinpoint human faces within that image. Several image processing algorithms have been introduced to tackle the task of face detection, not only detecting the presence of faces but also determining their specific location in the image. In this context, our system employs the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) method, which has proven to be highly effective in detecting human faces within the provided images.

        <br>Face Positioning: A human face is characterized by 68 specific points or, in other words, 68 face landmarks. The primary objective in this step is to identify and locate these crucial facial landmarks while optimizing the positioning of the entire face within the image. To accomplish this, a Python script is employed to automate the detection of these face landmarks and ensure that the face is positioned as accurately as possible without introducing distortions to the image.
        
        <br>Face Encoding: Following the successful detection of faces within the provided image, the subsequent phase involves the extraction of distinctive and unique facial features for each individual. When we obtain the localization of a face, a set of 128 key facial points is meticulously extracted from the given input image. These 128-dimensional facial points are remarkably accurate and serve as the basis for identification, with the data being securely stored in a data file dedicated to facial recognition purposes.
        
        <br>Face matching: The final phase of the face recognition process involves a vital step in our system. Here, we employ a state-of-the-art learning technique known as deep metric learning, known for its exceptional accuracy and its capacity to generate real-valued feature vectors. Within our system, we validate the faces by creating a 128-dimensional embedding, or what we refer to as "ratification," for each face. This process leverages the internal "compare_faces" function to calculate the Euclidean distance between the face in the image and all faces stored in the dataset. If the current image's match with the existing dataset exceeds a threshold of 60%, the system proceeds to mark attendance based on the recognized match.
        
        
        <br>Attendance Marking: Once a face is successfully identified by matching it with the images stored in the JSON file, Python proceeds to generate the roll numbers of the students who are present. These roll numbers are then returned as output. Following this, the system dynamically constructs an attendance table, meticulously detailing the name, roll number, date, day, and time, along with the corresponding subject ID. Subsequently, this data is handed over to Python, which, in turn, manages the automatic creation of an Excel sheet to store this information. Each sheet is organized in accordance with the subjects entered by the administrator. For example, when the system triggers the generation of an Excel sheet, it transmits the compiled data in an array to Python. Python, in its role, initiates a check to determine whether an Excel sheet for the given date already exists. If one is found, it proceeds to create a separate worksheet specific to the subject ID. This meticulous approach ensures the clear differentiation of attendance records for various subjects within the Excel sheet.
